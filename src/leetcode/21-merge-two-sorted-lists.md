## Problem

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

## Solution

Compare two nodes' values and append a smaller one to a temporary head. Repeat this process until there's no more nodes to compare with.

After the iteration, one of the list may have some nodes left in the list. We can simply append all of those nodes to our temporary list.

The time complexity of this solution is `O(max(M, N)), M = length of list 1 and N = length of list 2`.

```ts
type NodeType = ListNode | null;

function mergeTwoLists(list1: NodeType, list2: NodeType): NodeType {
  let dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
  let curr = dummyHead;

  while (list1 && list2) {
    if (list1.val < list2.val) {
      curr.next = new ListNode(list1.val);
      list1 = list1.next;
    } else {
      curr.next = new ListNode(list2.val);
      list2 = list2.next;
    }

    curr = curr.next;
  }

  if (list1) curr.next = list1;
  if (list2) curr.next = list2;

  return dummyHead.next;
}
```
