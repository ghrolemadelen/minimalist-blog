# Note

My handle, `rolemadelen`, is derived from the term _role model_. Back in August 2022, my friend, the bread lover, modified this term and used it to describe as a joke.


> "Damn Blue... my role madelen..."

_Just for your information, Blue was my old English name._

The moment I saw this word, I just fell in love with it. Since then, I started using it as my handle.
