I have to admit, it's become a bit of a habit for me to reach for my phone and check social media as soon as I wake up. Instagram, BlueSky, and Twitter (or X).

This morning, however, I had a little realization. I felt like spending so much time on these platforms wasn't really benefiting me.
Especially with X, I've noticed an influx of negative content lately. Even though I don't follow those accounts, it somehow finds its way into my timeline,
and I'm just tired of reading it all. So, I decided to take action and removed X and deactivated my account.
The same goes for BlueSky, which I barely use; it seemed unnecessary to keep it on my phone.

But I'm not cutting myself off completely from social media.
I'll still be keeping Instagram, as it's the place where I connect with my real-life friends.

With these changes, I'm looking forward to starting my mornings on a more positive note, focusing on the things that truly matter and surrounding myself with uplifting content and meaningful connections.

_Update - August 10th, 2023_

I noticed I was spending a lot of time on Instagram shorts and reels, so I made the choice to remove the app from my phone. However, I'm currently taking on a challenge for the month of August where I draw something new every day and share it on my account. For the purpose of posting my drawings, I'll reinstall the app temporarily and then promptly remove it afterward.

I'm back to X (Twitter) to expaind my network with developers around the world ðŸ˜‚
