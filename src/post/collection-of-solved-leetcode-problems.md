Starting from August 12th, I've planned to engage in solving a LeetCode problem daily.
While I can't determine the exact duration I'll commit to, my initial target spans over a period of 30 days.

The levels of difficulty are visually represented by emoticons: 🍰 (_shortcake_) designates an **easy** problem, 😾 (_pouting cat_) signifies a **medium** one, and 🙀 (_weary cat_) denotes a **hard** challenge.
