Since August 12th, I've planned to engage in solving a LeetCode problem daily.
While I can't determine the exact duration I'll commit to, my initial target spans over a period of 30 days.

The levels of difficulty are visually represented by colored circles: ðŸŸ¢ designates an _easy_ problem, ðŸŸ  signifies a _medium_ one, and ðŸ”´ denotes a _hard_ challenge.
