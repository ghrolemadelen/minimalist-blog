### Problem

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

### Solution

```ts
function reverseWords(s: string): string {
  return s.trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ').split(' ').reverse().join(' ')
}
```
